1\. What does the test statistic tell you?

- It indicates how many standard errors a point estimate lies from the expected null hypothesis population value.

30\. What is a characteristic of the t-distribution?

- The t distribution has a mean of one.
- The t-distribution has the same shape as the normal distribution.
