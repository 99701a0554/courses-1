## Overview

The main goal of this project is to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) for *Motor Trend*, a magazine about the automobile industry. We are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

## Exploratory data analysis

To answer these questions, we will use the `mtcars` data set. This data was extracted from the 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine. It comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

The `mtcars` data set has 32 observations of 11 variables:
```{r}
str(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

## Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG

## Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
