# Basic Statistics

Understanding statistics is essential to understand research in the social and behavioral sciences. In [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics/) you will learn the basics of descriptive statistics; not just how to calculate them, but also how to evaluate them.

This course should take about 8 weeks to complete. The recommended course schedule below gives you a quick overview of the lessons and assignments to complete each week. The course load might be a bit heavier than you’re used to if you’ve taken MOOCs before. This course is part of a [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/social-science) - a series of courses - where we cover all the methods and statistics topics that are typically offered in a bachelor program in any social or behavioral field of study.
